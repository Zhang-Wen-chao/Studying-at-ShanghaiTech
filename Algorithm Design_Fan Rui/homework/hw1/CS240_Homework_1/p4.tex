\problem{}
Suppose you have $n$ identical-looking cards.  Each card has an ID, which you cannot see, and there may be multiple cards with the same ID.  You are given a machine which can take two cards at a time and determine whether the cards have the same ID.

Give an algorithm which uses the machine $O(n \log n)$ times, and determines whether there exists an ID which occurs on more than $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ cards.  For example, if the cards have IDs $\{1, 2, 2, 2\}$, then the algorithm should return yes, while for $\{1,2,3,3\}$ it should return no.  You can assume that $n$ is a power of 2.
