\problem{}
Consider the following method for sorting $N$ elements stored in an array $A$, called \emph{selection sort}.  First, find the smallest element in $A$ and swap it with element  $A[1]$.  Next, find the second smallest element in $A$ and swap it with the element $A[2]$. Continue this way for the first $N-1$ elements in $A$. Analyze its best and worst case time complexity using big-O notation.
