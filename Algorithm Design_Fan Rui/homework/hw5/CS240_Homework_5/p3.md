Consider the following simple model of gambling in the presence of bad odds. At the beginning, your net profit is 0. You play for a sequence of $n$ rounds. In each round, your net profit increases by 1 with probability 1/3, and decreases by 1 with probability 2/3.
Show that the expected number of steps for which your net profit is positive can be upper-bounded by an absolute constant, independent of the value of $n$.

To analyze the expected number of steps for which your net profit is positive, let's define a random variable X to represent the number of steps until your net profit becomes zero. We want to show that the expected value of X can be upper-bounded by an absolute constant, regardless of the value of n.

In each round, your net profit increases by 1 with probability 1/3 and decreases by 1 with probability 2/3. This means that the probability of taking a step backward (from a positive net profit to zero) is higher than the probability of taking a step forward (from a zero net profit to positive).

Let's consider the probability of taking a step forward, i.e., transitioning from a zero net profit to a positive net profit. In order for this transition to occur, the previous step must have resulted in a decrease (a step backward) and the current step must result in an increase (a step forward). The probability of the previous step being a decrease is 2/3, and the probability of the current step being an increase is 1/3. Therefore, the probability of taking a step forward is (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9.

Now, let's consider the probability of taking a step backward, i.e., transitioning from a positive net profit to zero. In order for this transition to occur, the current step must result in a decrease. The probability of the current step being a decrease is 2/3.

Since the probability of taking a step forward (2/9) is smaller than the probability of taking a step backward (2/3), we expect that, on average, it will take fewer steps to transition from a positive net profit to zero compared to transitioning from zero to a positive net profit.

Let's denote the expected value of X as E(X). We can express E(X) using the law of total expectation:

E(X) = (2/9) * 1 + (2/3) * (1 + E(X)),

where (2/9) * 1 represents the probability of taking a step forward and 1 is the number of steps taken in that case, and (2/3) * (1 + E(X)) represents the probability of taking a step backward and then an additional E(X) steps.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

E(X) = (2/9) * 1 + (2/3) + (2/3) * E(X).

Rearranging the terms, we have:

(1 - (2/3)) * E(X) = (2/9) * 1 + (2/3).

Simplifying further, we get:

(1/3) * E(X) = (6/9) + (6/9).

(1/3) * E(X) = (12/9).

E(X) = 4.

Therefore, the expected number of steps until your net profit becomes zero (i.e., the expected number of steps for which your net profit is positive) can be upper-bounded by an absolute constant of 4, independent of the value of n.
