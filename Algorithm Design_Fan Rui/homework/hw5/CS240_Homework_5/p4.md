Given a set of items, where the $i$'th item has size $c_i$ ($c_i > 0$), we want to place them in as few bins as possible.  Each bin has a capacity $V$, where $V \geq \max_i c_i$.  To try to minimize the number of bins used, we take the following steps.  We start with one active bin, then iterate through the items one by one and try to place the item into any active bin which can accommodate it.  If an item cannot fit into any active bin, we open a new active bin. The algorithm is shown below.  Prove that this algorithm is a 2-approximation, i.e. the number of bins it uses is at most twice the minimum possible number of bins required.

\textbf{Algorithm:}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetKwInOut{Input}{Input}
\SetKwInOut{Output}{Output}

\Input{Set of items with sizes $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$}
\Output{Number of bins used}

Sort the items in non-decreasing order of their sizes: $c_1 \leq c_2 \leq \ldots \leq c_n$

\For{$i \leftarrow 1$ \KwTo $n$}{
\For{$j \leftarrow 1$ \KwTo $k$}{
\If{item $i$ fits into active bin $j$}{
place item $i$ in bin $j$

break
}
}
\Else{
%\If{Garbage piece $i$ does not fit into any active garbage bin}{
open a new active bin $k+1$

$k \gets k+1$

place item $i$ in bin $k+1$;
}
}
\Return{number of active bins $k$}
\end{algorithm}

To prove that the given algorithm is a 2-approximation, we need to compare the number of bins used by the algorithm with the minimum possible number of bins required.

Let's denote the number of bins used by the algorithm as $k$, and let $OPT$ represent the minimum possible number of bins required.

To establish the 2-approximation guarantee, we'll consider two cases:

Case 1: $k \leq 2 \cdot OPT$
In this case, the number of bins used by the algorithm is already within the desired approximation factor. Therefore, we can conclude that the algorithm is a 2-approximation.

Case 2: $k > 2 \cdot OPT$
In this case, we have more than twice the number of bins used by the algorithm compared to the optimal solution. We'll show that this situation is not possible, leading to a contradiction.

Since the algorithm uses $k$ bins, each with a capacity of $V$, the total capacity of all bins used by the algorithm is $k \cdot V$. Moreover, as stated in the problem, $V \geq \max_i c_i$, meaning that the largest item can fit in a single bin.

Since $k > 2 \cdot OPT$, there must be at least $k/2$ bins used by the algorithm that are not used in the optimal solution. Let's consider these $k/2$ bins. Since each bin has a capacity of $V$, the total capacity of these bins is $(k/2) \cdot V$.

Now, let's consider the $k/2$ largest items that were placed in these additional bins. Each of these items has a size of at least $c_{n-k/2+1}$. Since the algorithm sorts the items in non-decreasing order, we know that $c_{n-k/2+1}$ is at least as large as the $k/2$ smallest items used in the optimal solution.

Therefore, the total size of the $k/2$ largest items in the algorithm's additional bins is at least the total size of the $k/2$ smallest items in the optimal solution.

However, this contradicts the fact that the total capacity of the algorithm's additional bins is $(k/2) \cdot V$, which should be greater than or equal to the total size of the $k/2$ smallest items in the optimal solution.

Thus, we have reached a contradiction, which means that $k$ cannot be greater than $2 \cdot OPT$.

In both cases, we have either $k \leq 2 \cdot OPT$ or $k > 2 \cdot OPT$ resulting in a contradiction. Therefore, the algorithm is a 2-approximation.

Note: The proof assumes that the algorithm correctly determines whether an item can fit into an active bin or not. Additionally, it assumes that the algorithm places items into bins in a valid manner, obeying the bin capacities. These assumptions are crucial for the correctness of the proof.
