\problem{}

Suppose you want to estimate the fraction $f$ of people who skateboard in ShanghaiTech. Assume that you can select a ShanghaiTech student uniformly at random and determine whether they skateboard. Also, assume you know a lower bound $0 < a < f$. Design a procedure for estimating $f$ by some $\hat{f}$ such that Pr$[|f - \hat{f}| > \varepsilon f] < \delta$, for any choice of constants $0 < a, \varepsilon, \delta < 1$. What is the smallest number of residents you must query?
