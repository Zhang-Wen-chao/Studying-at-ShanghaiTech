\problem{}
Suppose that there are $n$ items which need to be placed in some bins. The capacity of each bin is 1.  The volumes of the items may not be the same and all volumes are smaller than 1.  We want to use the fewest number of bins to place all items.  Design a 2-approximation algorithm to solve this problem.
