\problem{}
Given an array $A$, find the longest continuous increasing subsequence in the array and return its length. For example, for the array [1, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 8, 9], the longest continuous increasing subsequence is [6, 8, 9] and its length is 3. 

\noindent Design an algorithm, prove its correctness, and analyze its time and memory complexity.
