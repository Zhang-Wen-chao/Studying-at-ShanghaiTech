\problem{}
Suppose there are $n$ players playing games. Every player plays exactly one game with every other player.  Every game has a winner (there are no ties).  Given an input vector $(v_1, ..., v_n)$, design an efficient algorithm to determine whether it is possible for player $i$ to win exactly $v_i$ games, for $1 \leq i \leq n$.
