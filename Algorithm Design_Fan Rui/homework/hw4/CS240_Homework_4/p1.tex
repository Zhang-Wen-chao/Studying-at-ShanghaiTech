\problem{}
Suppose you are the manager of a clothing store which sells $j$ different jackets and $h$ different shirts. $c$ customers come to the store, and each of them has a set of jackets and shirts which they like.  Each customer will either buy one jacket and one shirt from the set he likes, or nothing at all.  The customer is satisfied if he buys one jacket and one shirt.  In addition, each jacket or shirt can be sold to at most one customer.  Design an efficient algorithm which maximizes the number of satisfied customers.
