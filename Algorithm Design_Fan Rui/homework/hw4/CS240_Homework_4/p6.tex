\problem{}
In the Knapsack problem, we have $n$ items, and the $j$'th item has weight $w_j$ and value $v_j$ ($j=1,\ldots,n$).  All $w_j, v_j$ values are positive integers. The question is whether there exists a subset of the $n$ items with total weight at most $W$ and total value at least $V$, for input values $W$ and $V$.  Show that Knapsack is NP-complete.
