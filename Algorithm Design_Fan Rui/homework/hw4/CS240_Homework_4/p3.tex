\problem{}
Let $C$ be a finite set and let $S$ be a collection of subsets of $C$.  The Set Packing problem asks whether, for an input value $k$, there exist $k$ sets from $S$ which are pairwise disjoint (i.e. no two sets share an element).  Show that Set Packing is NP-complete, using a reduction from the Independent Set problem.
