\problem{}A fastidious farmer wants to pick apples from the apple trees in his orchard.  His trees are arranged in a circle, so that the first tree is a neighbor of the last one.  To keep his orchard beautiful, he cannot pick apples from neighboring trees. \\You are given the number of apples on each tree.  Design an algorithm for the farmer to pick the maximum number of apples, and output this quantity. \\\noindent {\bf Input:} \\An array $A$ of $N$ numbers, where $N$ is the number of apple trees, and $A$ indicates the number of apples on each tree.  \\\noindent {\bf Output:} \\The maximum number of apples the farmer can pick which satisfies the above condition.\\\noindent {\bf Constraints:} \begin{itemize}    \item $1\leq N\leq 100$    \item $0\leq A_{i}\leq 1000$ for $A_{i}\in A$\end{itemize}\noindent {\bf Sample Input 1:}\\$[1, 2, 3]$\\\noindent {\bf Sample Output 1:}\\3\\\noindent {\bf Sample Input 2:}\\$[1, 2, 3, 1]$\\\noindent {\bf Sample Output 2:}\\4\\\newpage
