## 1. \problem{}

### User

\problem{}
A fastidious farmer wants to pick apples from the apple trees in his orchard.  His trees are arranged in a circle, so that the first tree is a neighbor of the last one.  To keep his orchard beautiful, he cannot pick apples from neighboring trees. \\
You are given the number of apples on each tree.  Design an algorithm for the farmer to pick the maximum number of apples, and output this quantity. \\


\noindent {\bf Input:} \\
An array $A$ of $N$ numbers, where $N$ is the number of apple trees, and $A$ indicates the number of apples on each tree.  \\

\noindent {\bf Output:} \\
The maximum number of apples the farmer can pick which satisfies the above condition.\\

\noindent {\bf Constraints:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $1\leq N\leq 100$
    \item $0\leq A_{i}\leq 1000$ for $A_{i}\in A$
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf Sample Input 1:}\\
$[1, 2, 3]$\\

\noindent {\bf Sample Output 1:}\\
3\\

\noindent {\bf Sample Input 2:}\\
$[1, 2, 3, 1]$\\

\noindent {\bf Sample Output 2:}\\
4\\

This problem is a variation of the House Robber problem, which is a common interview question. The basic idea is that you are a thief and want to rob houses along a street, but you cannot rob two neighboring houses.

In this problem, the farmer wants to pick apples from the apple trees in his orchard, but he cannot pick apples from neighboring trees. The trees are arranged in a circle, which adds another layer of complexity because it means the first and the last trees are neighbors.

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. The maximum number of apples the farmer can pick from the first `i` trees is either the maximum number of apples he can pick from the first `i-1` trees (if he does not pick from the `i`-th tree), or the maximum number of apples he can pick from the first `i-2` trees plus the apples on the `i`-th tree (if he picks from the `i`-th tree).

Because of the circular arrangement, we divide the problem into two separate cases: one where the farmer can pick from the first tree (and therefore cannot pick from the last tree), and one where the farmer can pick from the last tree (and therefore cannot pick from the first tree).

Here is a C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return nums[0];
    
    vector<int> dp(n, 0);
    
    // Case 1: Include first house, exclude the last one.
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
    for (int i = 2; i < n - 1; i++)
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);
    
    int max_apples = dp[n - 2];  // Keep track of maximum apples in this case.
    
    // Case 2: Exclude first house, include the last one.
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = nums[1];
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);

    max_apples = max(max_apples, dp[n - 1]);  // Compare with maximum apples in case 2.
    
    return max_apples;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` and a space complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of trees in the orchard. It takes linear time because we are simply traversing the array once. It takes linear space because we are keeping a dynamic programming array of size `n` to store the maximum number of apples the farmer can pick from the first `i` trees.

you didn't give me mian function

### ChatGPT

I apologize for the oversight. Here is a main function that reads from standard input:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return nums[0];
    
    vector<int> dp(n, 0);
    
    // Case 1: Include first house, exclude the last one.
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
    for (int i = 2; i < n - 1; i++)
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);
    
    int max_apples = dp[n - 2];  // Keep track of maximum apples in this case.
    
    // Case 2: Exclude first house, include the last one.
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = nums[1];
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);

    max_apples = max(max_apples, dp[n - 1]);  // Compare with maximum apples in case 2.
    
    return max_apples;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> nums(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> nums[i];
    
    cout << rob(nums) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This main function reads the number of trees from standard input, then reads the number of apples on each tree, and finally prints the maximum number of apples the farmer can pick.

## 3. You have written well, the two test examples ha...

### User

You have written well, the two test examples have passed. Can you write this program again in python language?

### ChatGPT

Sure, here is the equivalent Python solution:

```python
def rob(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]
    
    dp = [0]*n
    
    # Case 1: Include first tree, exclude the last one.
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
    for i in range(2, n - 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])
    
    max_apples = dp[n - 2]  # Keep track of maximum apples in this case.
    
    # Case 2: Exclude first tree, include the last one.
    dp[0] = 0
    dp[1] = nums[1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])

    max_apples = max(max_apples, dp[n - 1])  # Compare with maximum apples in case 2.
    
    return max_apples

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(rob(nums))
```

In this Python script, `input().split()` is used to read a list of integers from standard input. The numbers should be separated by spaces. `map(int, ...)` is used to convert the input to integers, and `list(...)` is used to convert the result to a list. Then the `rob(nums)` function is called to get the maximum number of apples the farmer can pick, and the result is printed to standard output.
