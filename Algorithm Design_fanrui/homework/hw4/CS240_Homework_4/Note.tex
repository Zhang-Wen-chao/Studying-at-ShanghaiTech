\noindent 
Note: When proving that a problem $A$ is NP-complete, clearly divide your answer into three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that $A$ is in NP.
\item Choose an NP-complete problem $B$. For any instance of $B$, construct an instance of problem $A$, so that the yes/no answers to the two instances are the same.
\item Show your construction runs in polynomial time.
\end{enumerate}
