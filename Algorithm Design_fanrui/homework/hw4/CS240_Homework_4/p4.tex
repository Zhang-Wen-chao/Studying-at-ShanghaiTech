\problem{}
Suppose you are organizing a summer sports camp which offers $n$ different sports, and you need hire camp counselors who are skilled at these sports.  You receive applications from $m$ people, where each person is skilled at some subset of the sports.  For an input value $k \leq m$, you want to determine whether it is possible to hire $k$ people, so that for each sport you hire at least one person skilled in that sport.  Show that this problem is NP-complete, using a reduction from the Vertex Cover problem.
