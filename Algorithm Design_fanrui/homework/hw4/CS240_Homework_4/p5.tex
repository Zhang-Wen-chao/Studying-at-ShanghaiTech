\problem{}
SIST wants to hire graduate students to TA courses.  Each course needs exactly two TAs, and there is a list of pairs of students who can TA a course together (i.e. if two students are not a pair from the list, they cannot TA a course together).  For a given input value $k$, we want to determine whether there exists a \emph{TA cycle} with $k$ distinct students $s_1, ..., s_k$, such that $s_1$ and $s_2$ TA a course together, $s_2$ and $s_3$ TA a course together, ..., and $s_k$ and $s_1$ TA a course together (note that each student in the cycle will TA two courses).  Show that this problem is NP-complete.
