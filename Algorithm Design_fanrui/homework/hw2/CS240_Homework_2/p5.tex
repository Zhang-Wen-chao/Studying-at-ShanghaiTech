\problem{}
Jack wants to invite his friend John to have a meal in a restaurant, but Jack only has $M$ yuan of money.  The restaurant has $n$ different kinds of dishes. The $i$'th dish costs $a_{i}$ yuan. John is picky and doesn't want to eat the same dish more than once.  John is also greedy, and wants to use up all of Jack's money.  John wants to know how many ways there are to order dishes so that each dish is ordered at most once, and the total price of the dishes adds up to $M$.   For example, if there are 4 dishes with price $\{1,2,3,4\}$ and Jack has $6$ yuan, then there are two ways John can order, namely the dishes with costs 1, 2, 3, or with costs 2, 4, and so the algorithm should output 2.

Design an efficient algorithm which takes Jack's money $M$ and the prices of $n$ dishes as input, and outputs the number of the ways to order the food which satisfy John's requirements. Analyze the complexity of your algorithm.
