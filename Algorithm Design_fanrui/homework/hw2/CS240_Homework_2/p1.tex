\problem{}
Consider a rural road (assumed to be a long line segment with a left and right endpoint) with a set of houses located along the road.  Unfortunately, there is no access to piped water in this area and the residents of the houses can only get water by digging wells. As the community leader, you want to dig wells at certain locations on the road so that each house is within at most four miles from a well.

Give an efficient algorithm to achieve this goal while minimizing the number of wells to be dug, and prove the correctness of your algorithm.
