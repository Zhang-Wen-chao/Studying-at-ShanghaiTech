\problem{}
Consider a directed graph $G = (V,E)$.  Let $X \subseteq V$ be a set of \emph{start nodes}, and $Y \subseteq V$ be a set of \emph{destination nodes}, and assume that $X$ and $Y$ are disjoint.  Your goal is to find a set of paths, where each path starts at a node in $X$ and ends at a node in $Y$, and none of the paths share an edge.  Design an efficient algorithm to determine if such a set of paths exist, and find such a set if possible.
