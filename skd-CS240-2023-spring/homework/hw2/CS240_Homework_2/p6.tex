\problem{}
Given two strings $s$ and $t$, an \emph{interleaving} of $s$ and $t$ is a string formed by first dividing $s$ and $t$ into $n$ and $m$ substrings respectively, for $n$ and $m$ differing by at most 1, and then concatenating the substrings in an alternating fashion.  In other words, let $\mathbin\Vert$ denote the concatenation operation, and write $s = s_1 \mathbin\Vert s_2 \mathbin\Vert ...\mathbin\Vert s_n$ and $t = t_1 \mathbin\Vert t_2 \mathbin\Vert ... \mathbin\Vert t_m$, for some strings $s_1, ..., s_n, t_1, ..., t_m$ and $|n-m| \leq 1$.  Then the interleaving of $s$ and $t$ is any of the strings $s_1 \mathbin\Vert t_1 \mathbin\Vert ... \mathbin\Vert s_n \mathbin\Vert t_m$,  or $s_1 \mathbin\Vert t_1 \mathbin\Vert ... \mathbin\Vert t_m \mathbin\Vert s_n$, or $t_1 \mathbin\Vert s_1 \mathbin\Vert ... \mathbin\Vert t_m \mathbin\Vert s_n$ or $t_1 \mathbin\Vert s_1 \mathbin\Vert ... \mathbin\Vert s_n \mathbin\Vert t_m$, depending on the sizes of $n$ and $m$.  For example, ``hodtog" and ``doghot" are both interleavings of the words ``hot" and ``dog".

Suppose you are given three strings $r$, $s$ and $t$.  Give an algorithm to determine if $r$ can be formed by some interleaving of $s$ and $t$.  Analyze the complexity of your algorithm.
