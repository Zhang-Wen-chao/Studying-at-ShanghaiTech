\problem{}
Suppose you are given two sets  $A$  and  $B$ , each containing  $n$  positive integers. You can choose to reorder each set however you like. After reordering, let  $a_{i}$  be the  $i$'th element of set  $A$  and $b_{i}$  be the  $i$'th element of set  $B$. You then receive a payoff of  $\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}{ }^{b_{i}}$ . Give an algorithm that will maximize your payoff. Prove that your algorithm maximizes the payoff, and state its running time.
