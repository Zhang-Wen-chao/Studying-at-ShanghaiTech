\problem{}
The school is organizing a spring outing for students to Disney Amusement Park.  There are $M$ students, and park has $N$ areas ($M, N \geq 1$). We want to know how many ways there are to divide the students so that each student goes to exactly one area (we allow some areas to not be visited by any students).  Note that we only care how many students go to the different areas, not which areas they go to.  

For example, if there are 3 students and 2 areas, the output should be 2, because the only divisions are (3,0) and (2,1).  Note that here, we consider assigning 2 students to the first area and 1 student to the second, to be the same as assigning 1 student to the first area and 2 to the second; both assignments yield the division (2,1).

Design an algorithm for this problem and analyze its time and memory complexity.
